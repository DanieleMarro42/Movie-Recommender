**CineCluster** is a sophisticated movie recommendation engine developed as the final project for the **"Data Mining & Text Analytics"** university course. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze movie plots and provide personalized suggestions.

## 📖 Abstract

In the era of information overload, finding the right movie can be challenging. CineCluster addresses this by implementing a **Content-Based Filtering** approach. Unlike collaborative filtering which relies on user history, this system analyzes the *content* of the movies themselves (plots, genres, keywords).

The core of the project demonstrates the **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)** process:
1.  **Data Selection**: Utilizing a high-quality dataset of 1,000,000+ movies (filtered to the top 10,000 for performance).
2.  **Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning (Tokenization, Stop-word removal).
3.  **Transformation**: `TF-IDF` Vectorization to convert text into mathematical space.
4.  **Data Mining**: `K-Means Clustering` to discover hidden genre groups.
5.  **Pattern Evaluation**: `Cosine Similarity` to rank and recommend relevant titles.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🔍 Intelligent Search**: Real-time typeahead search with poster thumbnails.
-   **🧠 Powered Recommendations**: Analyzes the "DNA" of a movie (Plot + Genres + Keywords) to find its closest matches.
-   **📊 Cluster Analysis**: Automatically groups movies into 8 distinct thematic clusters (e.g., "Family & Fantasy", "Horror & Thriller").
-   **🖼️ Rich Visuals**: Fetches high-quality movie posters from TMDB for an immersive experience.
-   **⚡ High Performance**: optimized to load and query 10,000 movies primarily in-memory using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.

## 🧠 Methodology Details

### 1. Feature Engineering ("The Soup")
To improve accuracy, we don't just look at the plot. We create a "metadata soup" for each movie:
```python
soup = keywords + genres + overview
```

### 2. TF-IDF Vectorization
We use **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency** to convert this "soup" into a matrix.
-   **TF**: How often a word appears in a movie.
-   **IDF**: Reduces the weight of common words (like "movie", "film").
-   Result: A vector space where each movie is a point.

### 3. Cosine Similarity
To recommend movies, we calculate the angle between these points.
-   **Small angle (High Similarity)**: Movies share many unique keywords.
-   **Large angle (Low Similarity)**: Movies are unrelated.
