Acknowledgments

The authors of this project gratefully acknowledge Kaggle and The Movie Database (TMDB) for providing the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset, which served as the backbone for our Content-Based Recommendation System.

We also thank Dr. Alessandro Bruno and IULM University for the guidance provided during the "Data Mining & Text Analytics" course, which inspired the theoretical framework of this application.

Team Contributions:

This project represents a fully collaborative effort by Daniele Marro, Enrico Forneris, and Diego Casati.

Adopting a proactive and joint development approach, all team members contributed equally to every phase of the project lifecycle:

D. Marro, E. Forneris, and D. Casati jointly conducted the preliminary research on NLP techniques (TF-IDF), Cosine Similarity, and K-Means Clustering algorithms to define the project scope.

D. Marro, E. Forneris, and D. Casati collaborated on the Python implementation, working together on data cleaning, coding the recommendation logic, and debugging the script.

D. Marro, E. Forneris, and D. Casati collectively curated the project documentation, the README file, and the GitHub repository structure to ensure compliance with the submission guidelines.
